# Edsger

*Graph algorithms in Cython*

Welcome to the Edsger documentation! Edsger is a Python library for efficient graph algorithms implemented in Cython. The library currently focuses on shortest path algorithms, with Dijkstra's algorithm fully implemented and additional algorithms planned for future releases.

## Why Use Edsger?

Edsger is designed to be **dataframe-friendly**, providing seamless integration with pandas workflows for graph algorithms. Also it is rather efficient. Our benchmarks on the USA road network (23.9M vertices, 57.7M edges) demonstrate nice performance:

### Pandas Integration Made Simple

```python
import pandas as pd
from edsger.path import Dijkstra

# Your graph data is already in a DataFrame
edges = pd.DataFrame({
    'tail': [0, 0, 1, 2],
    'head': [1, 2, 2, 3], 
    'weight': [1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0]
})

# No conversion needed - use directly!
dijkstra = Dijkstra(edges, orientation="out")
distances = dijkstra.run(vertex_idx=0)
distances
```
    array([0., 1., 2., 3.])

## Key Features

- **Native pandas DataFrame support** - No graph object conversion required
- **High performance** - Cython implementation with aggressive optimizations
- **Memory efficient** - Optimized for large-scale real-world datasets
- **Easy integration** with NumPy and pandas workflows
- **Production ready** - Comprehensive testing across Python 3.9-3.13
