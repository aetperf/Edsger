# Edsger

*Graph algorithms in Cython*

Welcome to our Python library for graph algorithms. So far, the library only includes Dijkstra's algorithm but we should add a range of common path algorithms later. It is also open-source and easy to integrate with other Python libraries. To get started, simply install the library using pip, and import it into your Python project.
