# Edsger

*Graph algorithms in Cython*

Welcome to the Edsger documentation! Edsger is a Python library for efficient graph algorithms implemented in Cython. The library currently focuses on shortest path algorithms, with Dijkstra's algorithm fully implemented and additional algorithms planned for future releases.

## Key Features

- Fast implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Support for both single-source and single-target shortest paths
- Easy integration with pandas DataFrames
- Memory-efficient 4-ary heap implementation
- Path tracking and reconstruction capabilities
